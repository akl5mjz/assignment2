Additionally, they could explore alternative forms of data collection to actively include those who may have limited access to survey means.\n",

        "    Over the past decade, the conversation surrounding gender and gender as a social construct has gained significant awareness. The census could be improved by acknowledging the importance and complexities of gender identity, an aspect that is extremely relevant in today's cultural society. Overlooking this information can be harmful in examining the country's individuals and thier needs.\n",

It is also important to recognize and combat the rise of potential biases in not only how the data is cleaned, but how the data was collected intially.\n",

        "      Good practices would include recognizing the possibility for missing or inaccurate data and how that may affect the results. Offering disclaimers and being transparent about data cleaning decisions will also help mininterpreting information. Bad practices would include completely excluding or disregarding uncommon entries or falsifying data to fit a set of constraints\n",

        "6.  A concern I would have would be about the construction of the algorithm. Algorithtims often rely on patterns and correlations in the data to impute values, which can lead to inaccurate assumptions, create stereotypes, and perpetuate bias.  Also imputing values on someones behalf might not account for the context of nuances behind a specific variable. I would also be concerned about the privacy and identity of the respondents if the algorithms does not accurate reflect their response.\n"
